Games::3D:

* signal die() so that we can destroy links in game
* make Games::3D::Signal into an object which can get passed around instead
  of a simple number, allowing for TTL (TimeToLive - to avoid infinite loops
  when relaying signals) and the real signal origin to be passed around. Or
  maybe add this just as parameters to signal() and output() because this
  saves us the overhead of object creation/destruction!
* have Thingys send SIGNAL_DIED, SIGNAL_ACTIVATED, SIGNAL_DEACTIVATED
* Implement "Objective", to track player objectives per level (some that
  must be fullfilled, some that are optional, and some that should not
  be fullfilled, as well as changing them from "must/can fullfill" to "no
  longer necc."

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
