Games::3D:

* signal die() so that we can destroy links in game
* make Games::3D::Signal into an object which can get passed around instead
  of a simple number, allowing for TTL (TimeToLive - to avoid infinite loops
  when relaying signals) and the real signal origin to be passed around. Or
  maybe add this just as parameters to signal() and output() because this
  saves us the overhead of object creation/destruction!

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
