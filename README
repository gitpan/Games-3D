Games::3D - package to provide an in-game object and scripting system

=pod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a base object type that can be used as primary
game objects in a 3D game.

The base class is C<Thingy>, which gives things an ID, and a name as well
as a state (activated, deactivated, on, off etc) as well as the capability
to send/receive signals and to be linked to other objects.

There is also a C<Link> (which is a C<Thingy> nderneath), which can be used
to link other C<Thingy>s together in complicated ways (the link basically
relays signals between the C<Thingy>s).

This allows you to build signal networks that can track state changes.

In a typical game there would be exist both virtual objects (like Marker and
SoundSources, Camera) as well es physical objects like NPCs, the Player, Button,
Switch, Lever etc.

Please see the documentation in lib/Games/3D.pm for an overview and a very
detailed discussion.

For some background information, as well reasoning why this was developed and
why in this way, browse to:

Installation
============

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.09 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf Games-3D-0.09.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc or
  from my CPAN directory. Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped
  stuff):

	cpansign --verify

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised!

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Make the project

	make

* Run the tests:

	make test

* If some tests fail, please notify me.

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

Now download Games::Irrlicht from CPAN and look at it's examples to see how to
use this.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
